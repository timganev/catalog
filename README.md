# Product Catalog

## Getting Started
To test or just see what I did follow few easy steps:

- install NODE: https://nodejs.org/en/
- clone the repository
- run the Java back end (you can test it on port 5000):
![app start](./img/rec1a.gif)


- cd to the directory with the React front end ` /frontEnd/ReactCatalog`
- run `yarn install` (or `npm install` if you don't use yarn):
![app start](./img/rec1b.gif)


- run the front end app using `yarn start` (or `npm start`)
- expected output in terminal `Compiled successfully!` (and should auto open browser to port 3000)
- when the application starts there are 2 external links - to my CV and to this repository:
